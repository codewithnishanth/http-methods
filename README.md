# ASP.NET Core HTTP Methods Demo

This project is built with **ASP.NET Core** and **C#**, showcasing the implementation of all major HTTP methods in a RESTful Web API:

- `GET` â€“ Retrieve resources
- `POST` â€“ Create new resources
- `PUT` â€“ Replace existing resources
- `PATCH` â€“ Partially update resources
- `DELETE` â€“ Remove resources
- `HEAD` â€“ Retrieve headers without a response body
- `OPTIONS` â€“ Discover allowed methods
- `TRACE` â€“ Echo the received request (for diagnostics)
- `CONNECT` â€“ (Simulated) Establish a tunnel (e.g., for HTTPS)

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- ASP.NET Core Web API
- C# (.NET 6 or later)
- Swagger / OpenAPI (for testing endpoints)

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

To serve as a learning tool and reference for developers who want to understand the practical use and differences between HTTP methods in modern web APIs.
